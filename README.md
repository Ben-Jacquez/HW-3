## Deployed Website
[Deployed Version Here](https://ben-jacquez.github.io/password-generator/)

## Description
This project is a basic password generator that generates a password between 8 and 128 characters. It provides options to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and special characters. If you ever need a password with said options, then this will generate it for you. I built this with the intent to put my javascript skills into practice along the way I gained confidence in my variables, functions, and joining arrays.
